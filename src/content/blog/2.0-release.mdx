## What is PixiEditor?

Up until today, PixiEditor was known as a pixel-art editor. Version 2.0 is much more than that. **A Universal 2D Editor - a brand new category of 2D editors**.

It's not yet another Photoshop alternative. We take the word "Universal" much more seriously. We built an extremely configurable raster/vector render pipeline, which you can adjust for any workflow you can think of.

**Our goal is to build a free and open source editor that can handle most of 2D graphics** 

- Raster 
- Vector, 
- Animations,
- Procedural

Need to create a thumbnail for your YouTube video? Done. Edit SVG files? Easy. Create a pixel-art animation spritesheet? You bet.

Everything works offline, you own all the files. PixiEditor is available as a desktop app for Windows, MacOS and Linux!

_PixiEditor is a native desktop app, not a web app port. Most of its tech is written from scratch_

## What can it do?

[Q1 summary blog post](/blog/2025/3/19/2025-03-19-q1-status) very well describes most of the features present in PixiEditor 2.0. But in summary:

### Raster graphics

#### Pixel art

### Vectors

### Animations

#### Frame by Frame

#### Procedural

## Pixi Labs and Founder's Pack

One of the big changes that happened over past few months is the birth of Pixi Labs Sp. z o.o. - we've established a legal entity for PixiEditor related stuff. 

But don't worry, PixiEditor is still independent, free and open-source. We are not going to change that. However there are a lot of challenges when it comes to building open-source projects. The biggest is funding.

Over 1 year ago I left my job to finally develop PixiEditor full time. I want to keep it that way. I deeply believe in open-source and its importance in the world. Unfortunately we don't live in a utopia and 
I need to start earning money, both to buy myself food, keep PixiEditor infrastructure alive and ideally hire other PixiEditor contributors.

How are we planning to earn money? 

The deal is simple. We'll be maintaining and developing PixiEditor for free and in the meantime we will create useful paid extensions and assets that you'll be able to buy.

It's a win-win.

### Founder's Pack

A very first paid extension we've just released with 2.0 Release is **Founder's Pack**, and is available today. 

For the old timers, Founder's Pack is a upgraded _Supporter Pack_, so if you've purchased Supporter Pack, you'll get the update for free. We are retiring Supporter Pack as Founder's Pack replaces it.

#### What does it offer? 

Let's start with the juciest things, **workspaces**.
