## Announcing PixiEditor Forum
We're very happy to announce, that we've just launched https://forum.pixieditor.net/ !

It's a place where you can have long-lasting discussions, that are easily searchable in google. 

### Why?
Discord has a major flaw, it is not indexable by search engines, meaning that if we help one person to fix their issue, whole conversation is gatekept on the server and most likely lost in flood of messages. 

By using a traditional forum, we can help much bigger audience faster. Except issue solving, you can have a meaningful, long-lasting conversations easily. All feature requests, ideas, tips and everything else is much better accessible on PixiEditor Forum.

Also we have cool badges and reputation system there, so you can build your reputation on forum and become a trustworthy person, even for outsiders in PixiEditor Community.

Don't wait
