## Discord Overlay breaks PixiEditor's modals and input fields

If you are using Discord and PixiEditor simultaneously, you might have noticed that the latest Discord update introduced a bug that affects PixiEditor's modals and input fields. 
This issue is caused by Discord's in-app overlay feature, which interferes with PixiEditor's user interface.

## How to Disable Discord Overlay

To fix this issue, you can disable the Discord overlay feature by following these steps:

1. Open Discord and go to User Settings.
2. Navigate to the "Game Overlay" tab.
3. Click on the arrow, next to the toggle called "Enable Overlay"
4. Toggle off the overlay for PixiEditor specifically. You may also need to do the same for "Legacy Overlay" if issue persists.

Disabling the overlay should resolve the conflicts with PixiEditor's interface and restore normal functionality. We are in contact with Discord's team to address this issue.
