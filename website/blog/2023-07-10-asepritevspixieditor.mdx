# Introduction

Aseprite is one of the most popular pixel art editors out there, it has been around for a long time and it is primary choice for a lot of pixel artists. If you're wondering if PixiEditor is a good alternative to Aseprite, then this article is for you.

I am the creator of PixiEditor, but I'll try to be as objective as possible. I will compare the features of both editors, use cases and other things that might be important. However, the answer to the question "which is better" is not that simple. It depends on what you want to achieve. None of the editors is better than the other in every way, they have different quirks and features, which you might like or dislike.

The comparison will be based on Aseprite 1.2.40 and PixiEditor 1.1.3.0.
Please check PixiEditor [Roadmap](/roadmap) to see what features are planned for the future.
