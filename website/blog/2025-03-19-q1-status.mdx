PixiEditor 2.0 is feature complete! Check out all the new stuff that are coming to final release.

{/*truncate*/}

## The goal of PixiEditor 2.0

Before we dive into the new hot stuff in PixiEditor and summarize it's state, let's remind what PixiEditor is even trying to solve and what is it's purpose.

PixiEditor is no longer just a pixel-art program, version 2.0 evolved from it's 1.0 predecessor into a universal 2D graphics editor. Our goal is to build a tool that can handle most if not all your 2D needs.
Everything for free and open-source, just like Blender with 3D.

In short PixiEditor 2.0 let's you:

- Create pixel art with specialized tools
- Paint with color palettes and swatches
- Edit photos, make color adjustments, apply filters create and edit text
- Create vectors and open SVGs.
- Create frame by frame animations
- Make procedural art and animations using nodes
- Open Images, SVGs, Font files
- Create custom shaders and gradients
- Build workspaces for your needs with Node Graph

And this is far from a finished list, it's what possible at the moment, but we want to implement: 

- Vector animations
- Extensions with VSCode like extension store
- Node-powered brush engine
- RAW editing tools
- Infinite canvas

and much more!

## PixiEditor 2.0 is feature complete

Yes, that's right, PixiEditor 2.0 is feature complete, meaning that every big feature we planned is implemented.

:::info
We'll be still adding some smaller features for initial 2.0 release, "big" means core features that change PixiEditor in a significant way.
:::

Here's a list of highlighted features that PixiEditor 2.0 can do in it's current state

### Node Graph

Node Graph is one of the most powerful PixiEditor's features, it allows for creating effects previously only possible with specialized software such as game engines.

With classic layers + tools experience you can do very much, but with node graph, you can make almost anything. I'm not joking, it's just a matter of time until someone runs a Doom in it.

#### Basic overview

By connecting nodes you can make complex effects using simple rules. Every layer is a node and it can be connected to other nodes. 

Here are a few examples of custom node setups:

##### _"Drill" Brush_
<video src="/videos/stateq12025/Pond.webm" width={700} muted autoPlay loop controls/>

##### _Procedurally Generated Islands with seasons animation_
<video src="/videos/stateq12025/Island.webm" width={700} muted autoPlay loop controls/>

#### What nodes are available?

PixiEditor doesn't have a concept of Adjustment Layers, instead Node Graph is used to apply different kinds of effects, filters and adjustments.

There are a few main node groups:

**Filters**: Common image modifications such as Blur, Shadow, Grayscale, Color Adjustments etc. Filters can be chained to combine multiple effects into one.

![Filters](/img/blog-posts/stateq12025/monke.jpg)

**Image**: Nodes used to generate images and modify existing ones such as Noise, Tile, Mask and Modify Image Shader Graph

![Tiles](/img/blog-posts/stateq12025/Tiles.png)

**Effects**: Custom effects node such as Outline and Shader Node

![Effects](/img/blog-posts/stateq12025/Outline.png)

**Shape**: Nodes related to vectors like Text on path, Distribute points, Rasterize Shape

![Shapes](/img/blog-posts/stateq12025/shapes.png)

**Matrix**: Transformation related nodes such as Offset, Scale, Rotate, Skew

![Matrix](/img/blog-posts/stateq12025/transform.png)

**Animation**: Nodes related to timeline and animating. Mainly Time node that contains Active Frame and Normalized Time

<video src="/videos/stateq12025/Anim.webm" loop autoplay mute controls width={700}/>


**Numbers**: Math operations related nodes 

In version 2.0.0.66 there are 47 nodes but it's most likely not a final number for initial stable release.

#### Node Workspaces

To solve the issue of constant need of reattaching nodes to see their effect, we've implemented a special node called "Preview" which creates a custom output that can be toggled in the viewport settings

<video src="/videos/stateq12025/Workspace.webm" loop autoplay mute controls width={700}/>

In the video above, there's only a one file that has a graph with multiple outputs. By creating 3 viewports for the same image, you can preview all the outputs at once.

It's a very powerful option and allows for creating entire workspaces, we've made a [reusable pixel art case study](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghLrq0Wx41o) that utilizes this.

#### Custom Shaders

One of the elements that were tightly associated with game engines are shaders, or more like the ability to create custom ones. In PixiEditor 2.0 you have full control over that and we've built 2 ways you can make them.

1. Shader Graph (aka Modify Image Node) - it's a visual way to make shaders. It has low learning curve and allows for rapid prototyping.

![Shader Graph](/img/blog-posts/stateq12025/ShaderGraph.png)

2. Shader Node - It's a more advanced approach but more flexible, you can write shader code directly using language called SKSL.

![Shader Node](/img/blog-posts/stateq12025/ShaderNode.png)

You can use either built-in mini text editor to write shaders or open it in external app such as VS Code.

### Animations

One of the most requested features in PixiEditor 1.0 was frame by frame animations, and we've finally delivered. 

<video src="/videos/stateq12025/Slime.webm" loop autoplay mute controls width={700}/>

But that's not the end, except classic cels you can utilize node graph to create procedural animations.

<video src="/videos/stateq12025/Anim.webm" loop autoplay mute controls width={700}/>

You can render them as a video (gif, mp4) or export to spritesheet for your games.

One missing piece of the puzzle is key frame animations and vector animations, but that's coming later after 2.0 release.

### Toolsets

Toolset is a set of preconfigured tools for certain scenarios. The same tools in different toolsets might behave differently. 

For example pen tool (brush) is present both in pixel art and painting toolset, but in pixel art is preconfigured
for pixel-perfect drawing while in painting for high-resolution.

PixiEditor is built around the idea that you can mix all the toolsets in one document. 

Pixel art + vectors? More than welcome!

### Pixel Art Toolset

You can create pixel arts with dedicated tools, such as:

#### Brush with pixel-perfect option
<video src="/videos/stateq12025/PixelPerfect.webm" width={700} loop muted autoPlay controls/>


#### Transform (scale, move, skew, rotate, perspective) selection and layers
<video src="/videos/stateq12025/Skew.webm" width={700} loop muted autoPlay controls/>
#### Fill bucket
<video src="/videos/stateq12025/Fill.webm" width={700} loop muted autoPlay controls/>
#### Pixel-perfect shapes: Line, ellipse and rectangle
<video src="/videos/stateq12025/ShapesPp.webm" width={700} loop muted autoPlay controls/>
#### Non-destructive, pixel-perfect text tool
<video src="/videos/stateq12025/TextPp.webm" width={700} loop muted autoPlay controls/>
#### Pixel Eraser

I could put a video, but it's just a eraser, it erases pixels. Everyone knows how eraser work.

#### Brightness tool (darkens/lightens pixels)

<video src="/videos/stateq12025/Brightness.webm" width={700} loop muted autoPlay controls/>

### Painting Toolset

Painting toolset is suited for more traditional drawing and editing. All the tools are anti-aliased and suited for high-resolution scenarios.

It includes tools such as:

#### Brush and eraser with hardness and spacing settings
![SoftBrush](/img/blog-posts/stateq12025/SoftBrush.png)

#### Transform (scale, move, skew, rotate, perspective) selection and layers

<video src="/videos/stateq12025/Image Editing.webm" width={700} loop muted autoPlay controls/>

#### Fill bucket and magic wand with tolerance

![Selection](/img/blog-posts/stateq12025/Sele.jpg)

#### Anti-aliased shapes (line, rectangle, ellipse)

![Anti Aliased Shapes](/img/blog-posts/stateq12025/AAS.png)

#### Non-destructive text tool

![Meme](/img/blog-posts/stateq12025/Drake.png)

### Vector Toolset

PixiEditor natively supports editing vectors in High DPI, meaning you can edit low-res documents and combine it with vectors that will rendered crisp on the same canvas.

All vectors are non-destructive, they are preserved on separate layers and can be edited anytime.

It includes tools such as:

#### Path tool: Create BÃ©zier Curves and Polygons
<video src="/videos/stateq12025/Vectors.webm" width={700} loop muted autoPlay controls/>
#### Line, Ellipse and Rectangle
![Shapes Vector](/img/blog-posts/stateq12025/ShapesVector.png)
#### Text
![Vector Font](/img/blog-posts/stateq12025/mcf.png)

It's far from end of the list, vectors and vector layers are very powerful in combination with [Node Graph](#node-graph)

### Gradients

You can easily create 3 types of gradients: 

- Linear
- Radial
- Conic

by creating a shape and assigning a gradient to a fill or a stroke

<video src="/videos/stateq12025/Gradients.webm" width={700} loop muted autoPlay controls/>

It works on every shape and text from all toolsets. Some nodes also support picking gradients. The text in the video example is also made with a linear gradient.

### Autosave

Losing work sucks. That's why we've added snapshot autosave system that periodically makes a copy of your work, so you can live in peace. 

Additionally, PixiEditor saves sessions, so you can doodle whatever you want, close it and return to it later without manually saving.

### Linear blending

Unlike _a very popular_ blue program for editing raster graphics, we've set linear blending as a default. In short, linear blending is a more proper way to mix colors in computer graphics. If you are interested
about how it works in more detail, I recommend reading [this fantastic blog post by BjÃ¶rn Ottosson](https://bottosson.github.io/posts/colorwrong/).

We didn't get rid of sRGB blending, it is used by default when opening SVG files to maximally maintain visual coherence with web browsers. You can also manually set your document to use it via command palette (search bar on the top)

### Snapping

Making logos or any other vectors without snapping would be a nightmare, so we've added it.

<video src="/videos/stateq12025/Snappo.webm" width={700} loop muted autoPlay controls/>

### Supported Files

PixiEditor supports more file types than you can expect. It can open images, vectors, palettes and even font files. You can export images, SVGs and gifs/videos.

here's a full list:

<table><thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Open</th>
    <th>Save</th>
  </tr></thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>Png</td>
    <td>yes</td>
    <td>yes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Bmp</td>
    <td>yes</td>
    <td>yes</td>
  </tr>

    <td>yes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>WebP</td>
    <td>yes</td>
    <td>yes</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

*SVG is a huge format that supports tons of tags and features and PixiEditor doesn't support all of them.

  <tr>
    <td>Aseprite Shortcuts<br/>.aseprite-keys</td>
    <td>yes</td>
    <td>no</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

#### Ttf and Otf?

While PixiEditor is not suited for creating fonts, it can open ttf and otf files. It's especially useful when you want to edit glyphs in a font and put it in the logo or somewhere else (yes you can convert a text into a vector).

Additionally, using CTRL + SHIFT + C on a selected character, will copy it's unicode to the clipboard. 

I use it when working with PixiEditor icon fonts. Using PixiEditor to make PixiEditor is very cool.

### Other worth-noting features from 1.0

There are of course all the stuff from 1.0 that I didn't list. 

- Palettes System with browser
- Lospec palettes one-click import
- Symmetry drawing
- Grid
- Command Search

## Linux, MacOS and Founder's Edition

We are very happy to announce that 2.0 release will be available on all 3 major operating systems!

We have one _but_ though. We are a small team and I (flabbet) quit my job to make PixiEditor full time, donations on [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/pixieditor) are nowhere near close to provide a living for me, not speaking about compensating other core contributors. 

So to gather funds for further development, we've decided to create Founder's Edition, a version of PixiEditor that contains everything that [Supporter Pack](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2435860/PixiEditor__Supporter_Pack/) did + 
additional stuff that will be announced later, but it will be additional content (something like premade workspaces, node setups, assets with stuff that you can use in your art), not features. PixiEditor is free and will be fully free and open source.

In fact we are converting Supporter Pack to Founder's Pack. The price will also increase. If you own Supporter Pack, you won't need to pay additionally.

So, about that _but_, MacOS version will **only** be Founder's Edition until we gather enough funds to continue development. Please do not confuse this with making PixiEditor paid, if you want you'll still be 
able to compile it from source and run on MacOS without paying. 

Why MacOS and not other systems? It's simple, making apps for Apple devices requires money from the beginning, you basically can't distribute your app on apple devices without paying yearly fee to Apple. 

Also, _**PixiEditor for MacOS won't be on Steam until we release free version!**_ 

Microsoft Store version will also only be Founder's Edition, as a way to support us.

## What's next?

We have tons of plans, and we would like to implement a lot of awesome functionalities, however to make it happen we need your help!

If you support our vision and want to help, please [consider donating](https://pixieditor.net/donate) or contribute directly.

One of our biggest goals after 2.0 release is making proper extensions API with extension store (Similar to Visual Studio Code). 
Our extension API will utilize WASI components, which means you'll be able to write extensions for PixiEditor in almost any programming language!

## Contributing

We are looking for contributors!

## Summary

PixiEditor 2.0 is in a very advanced beta, which means that release of stable version will be quite soon, but I can't tell the exact date yet. However the beta is open, so if you want to play around it, [check it out here](https://pixieditor.net/docs/open-beta)

I hope to hear from you soon!
