In past few months we've been working hard on 2.0 release of PixiEdior.
Check out all the things we've been preparing.

# State of v2.0

New major release is still in progress, we've done some huge progress with
porting existing PixiEditor to a new UI framework - AvaloniaUI along with
modernizing core components, however it's still far from completion.

## What to expect from 2.0?

- First of all, PixiEditor will be **cross-platform**: Windows, Linux, MacOSX and even
browser. However not all platforms will be supported from the beginning.
(Support us on [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/pixieditor) for MacOSX version!)

- **Extensibility**, we are making PixiEditor code much more extensible, which means, that in
the future, you'll be able to create and install community made extesnions.

- **Themes**, you'll be able to create and edit the looks of editor (yes, setting those
 anime girls as a background as well, you weirdos)


 ## AvaloniaUI Color picker

 As a part of porting process, we've also made AvaloniaUI version of 
 our Color Picker, you can use it in your AvaloniaUI project! 
Check it out [here](https://pixieditor.net/colorpicker)

We have also started working on OkLab color space support.
Which will be represented as OkHsl and OkHsv pickers.

# In the meantime...

While we are working on all those 2.0 things, we are preparing a small update with
some QoL features and bug fixes. One of which is autosave!

Yes, finally. Crashes happen sometimes and losing your work because you didn't save is 
one of the most frustrating things, that's why we've decided to implement autosave.

Also, closing PixiEditor now saves your files, so whenever you open it again, your last session
will be recovered!
