# Announcing PixiEditor 2.0

We're excited to announce PixiEditor 2.0. A major update for our pixel art editor. 
Or is it still a pixel art editor? ðŸ¤”

## Universal Graphics Platform

We are shifting focus from being a pixel art editor to a general-purpose 2D graphics editor, with support for any type of 2D graphics.
Universal meaning _ANY_ type of 2D graphics, not just raster images. 

We are adding support for custom layers, tools, file formats and everything that defines a graphics editor. Do you want to draw
a landscape in a traditional way? PixiEditor 2.0 got you covered. What about vector shapes? Sure, we got that too. Procedural art? Easy. 
Animations? You bet we have that.

## Isn't it a little too ambitious?

Our aim is to build a community-driven platform, where extensions define the capabilities of the editor. The Core of PixiEditor 2.0 will contain
essential tools and features like raster image editing, vector shapes, animations, pixel art tooling and more. The rest will be defined by the community.

Our inspiration comes from a few programs that have similar approaches, but most notably, Visual Studio Code - a text editor which can highlight text in various programming languages, by itself it's pretty basic, but with extensions, it becomes a powerful 
tool for any developer. It's free, open-source and has a huge community behind it. We want to achieve something similar with PixiEditor 2.0 but for 2D graphics.

## What's new in PixiEditor 2.0?

Now let's dive into the juicy stuff. Here's a list of new features and changes in PixiEditor 2.0:

- Support for custom layers, we will provide a few new built-in ones: Raster, Vector and Procedural.

- Animations!
