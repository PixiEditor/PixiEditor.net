## Localization

Definately, the most important thing that comes with new update is localization. We've implemented whole new system for translations, that allows anyone to contribute to PixiEditor localization. 
We and our community managed to fully translate PixiEditor to 10 new languages, and we're looking forward to add more in the future.

So which languages are included in 1.1?

- German by [CPK](https://github.com/CPKreuz)
- Russian by [Equbuxu](https://github.com/Equbuxu) and [Cwumb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)
- Spanish by Spraf
- Portuguese by [Dystopixel](https://ln.ki/dystopixelart)

And more minor improvements and bug fixes. Check out full changelog below.


## What's next?

Our next big milestone is V2.0, which will bring PixiEditor to our beloved pengiun and oval fruit devices, which in normal language means Linux and MacOS support.
But in the meantime we are going to release minor patches, improvements and bug fixes. Thing that for sure will come in following weeks is alternative right click action and customizable grid size.

We are also working on 2 mysteries, which we will reveal soon.

Have fun assembling pixels!
