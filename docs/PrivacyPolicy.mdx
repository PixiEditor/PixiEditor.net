## Discord Rich Presence

PixiEditor supports [Discord Rich Presence](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/rich-presence/how-to) API. This means, your status
is publically displayed on your discord profile while using PixiEditor. By default this option is enabled.

Default PixiEditor Rich Presence publically shares information about:

All of the options can be disabled in the settings as well as Rich Presence itself.
