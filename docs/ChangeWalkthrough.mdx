# What happens when you use the pen tool

This is a a walkthrough of how the pen tool works internally. It should give you an idea of how various systems of PixiEditor work together.

Let's start from the very beginning, which is when mouse events appear in the UI.

### Viewport

When you draw on the canvas the mouse events are initially handled inside the `Viewport` user control. There, they are passed to IoViewModel by 
calling its RelayCommands (IoViewModel has relay commands that are bound to Viewport's dependency properties in MainWindow.xaml).

### IoViewModel, DocumentViewModel

`IoViewModel` filters all incoming mouse events to make sure they stay consistent, e.g. if a left mouse down event happens when the left 
mouse button is already down, it is ignored. `IoViewModel` then calls the mouse event handlers of ToolsViewModel and `DocumentManagerViewModel.ActiveDocument` 
which is the currently selected `DocumentViewModel`. 

ToolsViewModel initiates drawing by calling `DocumentManagerViewModel.ActiveDocument.UsePenTool()`. After this call, `ActiveDocument` starts using all incoming 
mouse events to control the pen.

### ActionAccumulator

Now we leave the UI layer and start to descend into `ChangeableDocument` which is part of PixiEditor's Core. When UsePenTool() is called, `ActiveDocument` 
creates a new `LineBasedPen_Action` which contains all the drawing settings (color, stroke width, ...) as well as the initial position on the canvas. 
As you draw, it creates more `LineBasedPen_Action`s with updated positions. Once you finally stop drawing, an `EndLineBasedPen_Action` is created. 
All of these actions are passed to this document's  `ActionAccumulator`. `ActionAccumulator` passes all of these actions to `ChangeableDocument`, which 
processes them asynchronously in a separate thread. Meanwhile, the UI thread goes back to processing incoming mouse events.

### ChangeableDocument

The actions that `ChangeableDocument` receives are used to control an instance of `LineBasedPen_UpdateableChange`. The instance is created when the first 
action is received, and the mouse positions from the following actions are used to update the change. Finally, once `EndLineBasedPen_Action` is received, 
the updateable change gets fully applied.

`LineBasedPen_UpdateableChange` uses the `EnqueueLine` method of the target `ChunkyImage` to draw lines. A new line is drawn after every update. In the 
end, when the `Apply` function is called, the affected chunks get saved, after which `CommitChanges` is called, solidifying all the drawn lines.

### Back to GUI

`LineBasedChange_UpdateableChange` emits a new `LayerImageChunks_ChangeInfo` on every update. This change info is passed to UI and used in `WriteableBitmapUpdater` 
to re-render the parts of the main `WriteableBitmap`s that were changed. The main canvas you see in the GUI is one of those bitmaps, so this is when you see the 
new stroke segment that you've just drawn.
