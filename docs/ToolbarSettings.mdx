# Introduction

[Setting](https://github.com/PixiEditor/PixiEditor/blob/master/PixiEditor/Models/Tools/ToolSettings/Settings/Setting.cs) is a core part of [Toolbars](https://github.com/PixiEditor/PixiEditor/wiki/Toolbars), Setting can be a simple CheckBox or a complex Color Picker. Every setting consist of:

- `Name` - A unique id, that allows identifying the setting and share values between toolbars.
- `Value` - A result value of the setting.
- `SettingControl` - UI part of Setting, a WPF Control.
- `Label` (optional) - Label for Setting, appears on the left from the control

# Pre-made Settings

Here is a list of some of the pre-built settings ready to use, for a full list, check out [source code](https://github.com/PixiEditor/PixiEditor/tree/master/PixiEditor/Models/Tools/ToolSettings/Settings)

- `BoolSetting` - Boolean Checkbox
- `ColorSetting` - Pop-up(Portable) color picker
- `DropdownSetting` - ComboBox with array of string values
- `FloatSetting` - A TextBox that accepts floating precision values
- `SizeSetting` - A TextBox that accepts integers (Size in pixels), adds "px" at the end of edit (Value is still integer)

## Creating existing Setting

```csharp
Setting setting = new DropdownSetting("Mode", new[] {"New", "Add", "Subtract"}, "Selection type"); //"Mode" is a name (ID), array is a list of values for 
                                                                                                   //DropdownSetting, "Selection type" is a label.
```
You can add `setting` to Toolbar as described in [this guide](https://github.com/PixiEditor/PixiEditor/wiki/Toolbars) and it will be ready to use.

# Creating a new Setting

Creating a Setting is not a hard task, but can be tricky sometimes. 

Let's get a simple example from source code.

```csharp
public class ColorSetting : Setting
    {
        public ColorSetting(string name, string label = "") : base(name)
        {
            Label = label;
            SettingControl = GenerateColorPicker();
            Value = Color.FromArgb(0, 0, 0, 0);
        }

        private PortableColorPicker GenerateColorPicker()
        {
            PortableColorPicker picker = new PortableColorPicker();
            Binding binding = new Binding("Value")
            {
                Mode = BindingMode.TwoWay
            };
            picker.SetBinding(PortableColorPicker.SelectedColorProperty, binding);
            return picker;
        }
    }
```

As you can see, a `Setting` requires `Name` as a parameter. It's good to pass a label as an optional one. We are providing transparent color as a default `Value` and generating `PortableColorPicker`.

The tricky part is in generating Control since you must bind correct values. 

In this example, we are binding "Value" (the Setting property) to the PortableColorPicker `SelectedColorProperty`. Usually, the principle is the same for most controls, but sometimes you might want to bind more things, check out [other source code files](https://github.com/PixiEditor/PixiEditor/tree/master/PixiEditor/Models/Tools/ToolSettings/Settings) for more reference. 

# Conclusion

The settings are a very comfortable way for easily setting up the tool values, Toolbar system takes care of getting the values and managing them. Building a Setting is easy but requires a bit of setup.
